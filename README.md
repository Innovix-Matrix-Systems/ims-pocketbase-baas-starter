## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Go 1.24+ (for local development)

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Innovix-Matrix-Systems/ims-pocketbase-baas-starter.git
   # you can also use the use template button and create your onw project from this template
   cd ims-pocketbase-baas-starter
   ```

2. **Setup environment**

   ```bash
   make setup-env
   # Edit .env file with your configuration
   ```

3. **Generate encryption key**

   ```bash
   make generate-key
   # Copy the generated key to .env file
   ```

4. **Start development environment**
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

### Production Setup

1. **Build and start production containers**
   ```bash
   make build
   make start
   ```

### Default Super Admin

- Email: `superadmin@ims.com`
- Password: `superadmin123456`

## Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration. Copy `env.example` to `.env` and update the values:

```bash
make setup-env
make generate-key  # Generate encryption key
# Edit .env file with your configuration
```

Key configuration areas include app settings, SMTP/email, S3 storage, job processing, rate limiting, and security. For complete configuration details, see the [Environment Configuration Guide](docs/environment-configuration.md).

## Available Commands

The project includes comprehensive Makefile commands for development and production:

```bash
make dev          # Start development environment
make dev-logs     # View development logs
make build        # Build production image
make start        # Start production containers
make test         # Run tests
make help         # Show all commands
```

For a complete list of commands and usage examples, see the [Makefile Commands Guide](docs/makefile-commands.md).

## Development Workflow

1. **Start development environment**

   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

2. **Make code changes** - Files are automatically watched and reloaded

3. **View logs**

   ```bash
   make dev-logs
   ```

## Project Structure

This project follows Go project layout standards with clean architecture and modular design. The codebase is organized into:

- **`cmd/`** - Application entry points (server, CLI tools)
- **`internal/`** - Private application code (handlers, hooks, middleware)
- **`pkg/`** - Reusable packages (cache, logger, metrics, utilities)
- **`docs/`** - Comprehensive project documentation
- **`monitoring/`** - Development and production monitoring configurations

For detailed information about the complete project structure, package organization, architectural decisions, and navigation guidance, see the **[üìÅ docs/](docs/)** folder which contains comprehensive guides for all aspects of the project.
